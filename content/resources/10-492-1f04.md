description: Are the manipulated variables sufficient to overcome disturbances? This
  plot shows the demands on hot and cold flow for various combinations of disturbances
  to a system. The disturbance combination is expressed as an angle, and the required
  flows are within limits in all cases. (Graph courtesy of Dr. Barry S. Johnston.
